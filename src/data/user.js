			"I am a creative developer focusing on website development and game development using the Godot engine. In web development, I design and build responsive, interactive, and user-friendly sites by utilizing technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks such as React or Node.js. While in game development, I mastered Godot Engine to create 2D/3D games with innovative mechanics, from concept design, programming using GDScript, to performance optimization and cross-platform publishing. The combination of technical skills, problem-solving, and a deep understanding of user experience allows me to deliver digital products that are functional, engaging, and fit users' needs.",
